### Question 1
For the parity and momentum operator we have:
$$
\Pi \hat{p} + \hat{p}\Pi =0
$$
And so these two operators anti-commute. Define the arbitrary eigenvalues such that:
$$
\Pi\ket{\psi} = \pm \ket{\psi} \qquad \hat{p} \ket{\psi}  = p\ket{\psi}
$$
And therefore we have:
$$
(\Pi\hat{p} + \hat{p}\Pi)\ket{\psi} = \Pi\hat{p}\ket{\psi} + \hat{p} \Pi \ket{\psi} = p\Pi\ket{\psi} \pm \hat{p}\ket{\psi} = \pm p\ket{\psi} \pm p\ket{\psi} =0
$$
Which is:
$$
\pm 2p\ket{\psi} =0
$$
- Does this imply that the eigenvalues are 0? Or does this mean the only case where something is the simultaneous eigenvalue of the parity and momentum operators is zero?
Furthermore,
$$
\bra{\psi} (\Pi\hat{p} + \hat{p}\Pi) \ket{\psi}  = \bra{\psi} \Pi\hat{p}\ket{\psi} + \bra{\psi} \hat{p}\Pi \ket{\psi} = \pm p \pm p^* =0
$$
Therefore,
$$
p=-p^*
$$
Which implies that $p$ is purely complex.
